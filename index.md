# Welcome to my portfolio


Hi! My name is David Mason. Here are a few of the things I've worked on.


## Javascript/HTML/CSS

#### Online apps

These are online applications built in JavaScript using Node, Express, React (a UI library), and MongoDB (a NoSQL database program).

#### Codepen projects

These are projects stored on codepen.io, where you can view and edit the code right in the page by selecting the "Editor View".


## C++

These C++ projects were written to compute or count mathematical objects.
